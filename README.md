# brew ☕  
a website for koe’s cafe - where design meets coffee and code.

---

## what it is  
a fully responsive single-page site for a local cafe in surat,  
built with react.js and styled using tailwind css.  
featuring menus, upcoming workshops, and a warm, welcoming digital vibe.

---

## my part  
i led the ui/ux from layout to color language,  
and designed the custom graphics, menu visuals, and aesthetic flow  
to reflect the cozy, handwritten charm of the actual cafe.
